# Diabolysis
Nowadays, everyoneâ€™s having some medical issue, so this is the main reason for making this project. This is a smart diabetes checking machine learning model. Basically, it takes some medical reports and classify them and gives an output. In this project I use linear regression machine learning algorithm to train the dataset, I use python 3.6 programming language to train this model and also use Anaconda platform. This is a smart application it will predict the diabetes result based on user data
